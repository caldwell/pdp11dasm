PDP11DASM version 0.0.3

To compile pdp11dasm, just type 'make'. Then copy the pdp11dasm program to
'/usr/local/bin' or any directory that is in your PATH environment variable.

This distribution includes a PDP-11 native assembler ('as') and control file
('as.ctl') as examples.

To run the example, type:
pdp11dasm as
then examine the output file 'as.das' with any text editor.

Documentation is in the file pdp11dasm.html.

Please report any bugs (or better yet, bug fixes) to the author at
